# Question 1
**Explain using code examples what is meant by props and state in React JS?**
Props in react are a way to pass data or properties between components. 
e.g.
``` {notes.map((note) => (
                <Note key={note.id} note={note} addChild={addChild} removeNote={removeNote} editNote={editNote} piratify={piratify}/>
    ))} ```
    
State is the realtime data available only in the component it is created in.
